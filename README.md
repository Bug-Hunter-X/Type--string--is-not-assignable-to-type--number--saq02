This repository contains a common TypeScript error and its solution. The error occurs when a function does not explicitly specify the type of its parameter, causing the compiler to infer the type as 'any'. This can lead to unexpected behavior. The solution demonstrates how to fix this error by explicitly specifying the type of the parameter, preventing the 'Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number' error.
